I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Psychiarty at the [Peking University Sixth Hospital]([https://www.nihds.pku.edu.cn/](https://www.pkuh6.cn/)), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yunai Su](http://www.pkuh6.cn/Html/Doctors/Main/Index_212.html). 

My research interests include：
1.Mechanistic analysis of psychiatric drugs. Most antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs were discovered serendipitously, and their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms and identifying potential targets of psychiatric drugs may facilitate the discovery of a new generation of therapeutics.
2.Bioinformatic screening of drug targets. Potential drug targets are identified using high-throughput, multi-omics approaches.
3.Drug delivery. Drugs are precisely delivered across the blood–brain barrier using nanoparticle-based delivery systems.

Education：
2020.09-2025.07：B.S, psychiarty, Wenzhou Medical University
2021.09-2024.09：Research Internship, Oujiang Laboratory (the Regenerative Regulation and Eye and Brain Health Zhejiang Provincial Laboratory), supervised by prof.Zhiqian Tong.
